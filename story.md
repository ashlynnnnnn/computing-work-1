_**Hansel and Gretel**_


Witches come in all shapes and sizes. Some spend their entire lives in isolation. Some ride broomsticks and terrorise
villagers while some perform magic tricks at birthday parties. Some look like the stereotypical old hag, with pointy 
noses and warts and skin as green as leaves, whereas some look like normal earthly beings. Some are nice while others 
are wicked.

I am the Candy Witch, and I am supposedly of the latter variety. You might have heard of the famous fairy tale _Hansel
and Gretel_. Yes, I am the very woman who is rumoured to have lured the "innocent" children into my gingerbread house,
locked Hansel in a cage, then tried to fatten him up so I could roast him for dinner.

However, that is all one big lie. (_Pfft, I would never be caught dead eating a human. They smell **and** taste disgusting._)
