_**Hansel and Gretel**_


Witches come in all shapes and sizes. Some spend their entire lives in isolation. Some ride broomsticks and terrorise villagers while some perform magic tricks at birthday parties. Some look like the stereotypical old hag, with pointy noses and warts and skin as green as leaves, whereas some look like normal earthly beings. Some are nice while others are wicked.

I am the Candy Witch, and I am supposedly of the latter variety. You might have heard of the famous fairy tale _Hansel and Gretel_. Yes, I am the very woman who is rumoured to have lured the "innocent" children into my gingerbread house, locked Hansel in a cage, then tried to fatten him up so I could roast him for dinner.

However, that is all one big lie. (_Pfft, I would never be caught dead eating a human. They smell **and** taste disgusting._)

The truth is that Hansel and Gretel are nasty little children who do not have an ounce of manners between them. They had been out in the dark forest one day, stomping on tiny insects and green ferns, ignoring "NO TRESPASSING" signs, when they saw a beautiful residence. The colourful house was covered in various types of candy, such as candy canes, caramel chocolate wafers and fruity gumdrops --- **my** house.

So, without asking for permission or waiting to be invited, they started to devour my house. Then, wanting more candy, the greedy children climbed through a window and started eating the interior. When I caught them in the act, I was very --- no, terribly --- upset. Anger stirred deep within me, yet I kept my cool. Calmly, I asked, "Dearies, whatever are you doing, eating my house? How would you like it if I ate yours?"

"Our house is made of bricks," Hansel chuckled, with a drawer handle of pepppermint candy canes sticking out of his mouth.

"And mortar," Gretel added between bites of a rope curtain made of black licorice, smirking. Her brother sniggered.

I frowned at their jeering remarks, my blood started to boil. "That is not the point, dearies. The point is that my house belongs to **me**. It is very rude to eat something that belongs to someone else!" I chided.
